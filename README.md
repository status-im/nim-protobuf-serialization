Protobuf implementation compatible with the [nim-serialization](https://github.com/status-im/nim-serialization) framework.

## Usage

Due to the complexities of Protobuf, and the fact this library makes zero assumptions about encodings, extensive pragmas are required.

Both Protobuf 2 and Protobuf 3 semantics are supported. When declaring an object, add either the `protobuf2` or `protobuf3` pragma to declare which to use. When using Protobuf 3, a `import_proto3` macro is available. Taking in a file path, it can directly parse a Protobuf 3 spec file and generate the matching Nim types.

Both Protobuf 2 and Protobuf 3 objects have the following properties:

- Every field requires the `fieldNumber` pragma, which takes in an integer of what field number to encode that field with.
- Every int/uint must have its bits explicitly specified. As the Nim compiler is unable to distinguish between a float with its bits explicitly specified and a float, `pfloat32` or `pfloat64` is required.
- int/uint fields require their encoding to be specified. `pint` is valid for both, and uses VarInt encoding, which only uses the amount of bytes it needs. `fixed` is also valid for both, and uses the full amount of bytes the number uses, instead of stripping unused bytes. This has performance advantages for large numbers. Finally, `sint` uses zig-zagged VarInt encoding, which is recommended for numbers which are frequently negative, and is only valid for ints.

Protobuf 2 has the additional properties:

- A `required` pragma is enabled, matching the syntax of Protobuf 2's required keyword.
- Every primitive value, such as a number or string, must have the `required` pragma or be a `PBOption`. `PBOption`s are a generic type instantiated with the default value for that field. They serve as regular Options, except when they're none, they still return a value when get is called (the default value). `PBOption`s can be constructed using `pbSome(PBOption[T], value)`.

For example:

```nim
type
  X {.protobuf3.} = object
    a {.pint, fieldNumber: 1.}: int32
    b {.pfloat32, fieldNumber: 2.}: float32

  Y {.protobuf2.} = object
    a {.fieldNumber: 1.}: seq[string]
    b {.pint, fieldNumber: 2.}: PBOption[int32(2)]
    c {.required, sint, fieldNumber: 3.}: int32
```

```nim

#[
protofile.proto3:
message X {
  int32 a = 1;
  float b = 2;
}
]#

import_proto3 "protofile.proto3"

#[
Generated:
type X {.protobuf3.} = object
  a {.pint, fieldNumber: 1.}: int32
  b {.pfloat32, fieldNumber: 2.}: float32
]#
```
